**************************************************

This code is to understand the simple but very important math behind the post processing after performing a mathematical 

operation on a set of numbers belonging to a certain range. Here we will explore an example of performing a convolution

on an image using a sobel filter and understanding the methods to follow after the convolution operation to conserve the 

pixel intensities of the given image or in simple terms to preserve the image information.


We make use of opencv's cv2.filter2d library for convolution along with our user defined method. This is important as it 

allows us to compare and bench mark our method in the code.
